// This file is intentionally left blank.
// The original content `/// <reference types="vite/client" />` was causing a
// "Cannot find type definition file" error, likely due to a project setup
// issue. As the code has been updated to no longer rely on Vite-specific
// `import.meta.env` types, clearing this file resolves the error without
// apparent side effects for the application's functionality.
